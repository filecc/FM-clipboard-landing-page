## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile and Desktop side by side workflow


### What I learned

I had some difficult trying positioning the image in the first section, so I decided to take a look at it later on. 
I worked side by side with Desktop an Mobile preview, so I was targetting everything before commit, to make sure that the elements were good enouught.
Love how I wrote +200 line of code and just 90 lines for the @media.
Sure, it can be better. 

As always the best help is this:


```css
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.social a:hover{
    filter: invert(60%) sepia(74%) saturate(437%) hue-rotate(121deg) brightness(88%) contrast(85%);
}
```
